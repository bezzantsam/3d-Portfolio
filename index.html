        <h2>üìú About me</h2>
        <p>
          Based in Beaverton Oregon I have a background in business. I am
          passionate about accessibility, Agile software development, education
          and React. New technology, libraries and frameworks capture my
          imagination.
        </p>

        <p>
          I value critical thinking with an impulsivity to remove bugs before
          production. A passionate dedication to perfection coupled with
          integrity guided by a moral compass is what defines me.

        CoderHeroes, Full-Stack Developer, Technical Project Manager
        <br />
        <a href="https://a.coderheroes.dev/"> CoderHeroes</a>
        <p>
          I am currently a technical project manager for this project. I have
          focused my team on the interdepartmental notes system. We have created
          this feature from the ground up using Whimsical and Figma for our
          designs and organizing our progress with Agile methodologies. Our
          progresses have been tracked using the Trello kanban boards.
          <br />
          During our daily stand up meetings we have scoped out the sprint's
          objectives and confirmed progress and direction with the stakeholders
          and our managers at sprint product reviews.
          <br />
          Using React and associated libraries, we have created an interactive
          notes system designed to streamline important communications with
          quick view priority levels and subject and an updatable resolution
          status. We have styled the designs with multiple libraries and CSS to
          make the user flow cohesive and easy to use.
          <br />
          Using PostgreSQL, we have created migrations with the Knex library to
          add persistence on a server level. We've created a RESTful API using
          Node.js with necessary middleware protecting our CRUD endpoints in our
          notes routers to add, edit, and delete notes

          dark/light theme toggle using hooks. Implementation of themes, inline
          component styles coupled with beautiful subject matter makes this app
          a joy to interact with.
